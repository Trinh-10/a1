										<h2>Personal Information</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Hello, my name is Alex Trinh but most people call me Trinh. My student number is S3897294 
										and my student email is s3897294@student.rmit.edu.au. I was born in Melbourne, Australia in 
										2002. I am half Chinese and half Vietnamese. Although I am unable to speak fluently in both 
										languages, I am slightly better at communicating in Cantonese. 
										For the past 6 years, I attended Simonds Catholic College and successfully finished Year 12 
										last year. I have a large variety of interests which range from gaming, sports, exercising, 
										cars, listening to music, exploring YouTube, eating food and singing even if I’m not the best 
										at it. As of right now, my current forms of exercise include swimming weekly and I learning 
										mixed martial arts (MMA) with my older brother.

											<h2>Interest in I.T.</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My interest in I.T. comes from the hours spent on games and the internet itself. 
											I’m also intrigued on how the technology in our everyday lives operate, such as our 
											phones, computers, etc. With the phones coming out yearly I would watch Marques 
											Brownlee on his tech breakdowns which I find pretty fascinating. Ever since my Dad 
											bought the sliding Nokia phone and I would play that one snake game I think was when 
											I got into technology. If not that then it would’ve been the time when he switched from 
											that phone the iPhone 3G. Looking back in to the past, it seemed surreal upgrading to a phone 
											with a huge touch screen system.</p>
										
										<p>I chose to study RMIT because its campus is so central to Melbourne and was most easily 
											accessible to me. Since I live in Maribyrnong it is only one tram ride away from the city campus. 
											It is also probably one of the better universities in Melbourne in my opinion. As I was also 
											interested in studying I.T., it seemed appropriate I study at RMIT having Technology in its name.</p>
										
										<p>During my three year course, I expect to learn a great deal which could help me in my everyday life. 
											This could range from understanding technology in a more in-depth level to learning life skills such as 
											communicating with team members which would assist me on my future career.</p>

										Click Here</a></p>
									<p>This job is a junior position that involves website developing and designing at a firm that strives to 
										transform society for the better using technology. This position appealed to me as I found learning HTML 
										and CSS satisfying and I would like to learn and apply it at a higher distinction. Designing a website and 
										making it aesthetically pleasing seems enjoyable in my day-to-day life.</p>
									
									<p>This Junior Web design position requires knowledge of front-end coding (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and how to design 
										and develop a website using these programming languages. The job entails creating new themes and templates also, 
										to improve and enhance the company’s current product The HiVE. It is expected to be aware of the current design 
										and technology trends in order to provide the best outcome for company’s clients. Important skills that would 
										benefit the job position is having excellent communication and problem-solving skills.</p>
									
									<p>My current qualifications are graduating high school and having little knowledge on the programming languages HTML 
										and CSS. I have communication skills and problem-solving skills that can definitely be improved to benefit me for 
										my future career. I believe I am very passionate on things I’m interested in and I would put the time and effort in 
										to learn and practice.</p>
									
									<p>The plan to acquire the skills, qualifications and experience required for this job is to graduate with a Bachelor’s 
										of I.T. while learning and practicing front-end coding during my studies. That way I have expert knowledge on how to 
										operate HTML and CSS to design and develop a website. I will improve my skills of communication through more work 
										experience or team activities.</p>

							<p>These results show me a better understanding of myself and how I can improve myself. Looking at my nature and identity
							   for the Myers-Briggs test, my decision making is based on feeling rather than thinking. I am quite often indecisive 
							   and self-conscious about myself. To improve myself, I have been trying to get myself out there being more extroverted 
							   and be more comfortable with the world. I agree with the learning style test and that I do tend to learn from listening. 
							   Although I have a tendency of getting distracted very easily. With the nerd test, I thought I would’ve been more of a 
							   nerd since I play a lot of games and quite intrigued into technology but apparently not.</p>
							
							<p>Looking at these results, I am able to improvise for the team and observe situations to resolve them quickly, that way 
								the team may solve any raised problems. I am also a great listener meaning I could take in other members ideas and 
								expand or improve them. The results also show that I am relaxed which could be a negative as some things should be 
								taken seriously.</p>
							
							<p>When forming a team, I should look for people with different traits and attributes. That way all group members have 
								something to bring to the table. For example, to compromise for my relaxing personality another group member could 
								be more organise. This way there is progress in the tasks that are required to be completed rather than improvisation.</p>

<!-- Project Idea -->
<section id="projectidea" class="main">
	<header class="major">
		<h2>Project Idea</h2>
	</header>
	<h4>Overview</h4>
	<p>My project idea is an application that helps students find the right tutors. Education is one of the top priorities 
		for the up-and-coming generation. That is why I feel this app should be created. The app will consist of profiles 
		of tutors acting as advertisements on what subjects they teach with ratings shown to students. That way students 
		can choose a tutor that’s right for them. With tutors and students using the app, they can both rate each other 
		anonymously providing information for other tutors and students on whether they want to learn or teach from that 
		person.</p>
	
	   <h4>Motivation</h4>
	   <p>This project idea would be useful to future generations education and helping students find the right tutors. 
		   I chose this idea because in my past high school years I couldn’t really find tutors who would help me to their 
		   fullest potential and weren’t that inclined to teach. Now that I realised how important it is receiving the best 
		   help, I want to create an app where students would have the opportunity to find the best tutors around.
		</p>
		  
		
		<h4>Description</h4>
		  
		<p>The application would be an educational service for students to help find tutors they want to benefit their education.
			   Upon opening the app, it would ask whether the user is a student or tutor. The user would then create a profile 
			   depending on whether they are a student or a tutor. Tutoring profiles would need to be approved by administrators. 
			   Once students have completed their profile, they are able to use the app. </p>
			
			   <p>The app would allow students to search for what subject they need assistance in. A list of tutors would 
				then load, showing their profile and their rating. Students are able to read the tutors profile and see 
				their expertise, past experience and availability. They would also see reviews from other students on their 
				previous tutoring sessions. </p>

				<p>Some features the app would have are a chat a feature for students and tutors to contact each other. 
					If a student has decided on a tutor, they can contact the tutor and schedule a time for a lesson. Students 
					can also use the chat feature to ask the tutor questions. Another feature would be a file and document section 
					where work can be stored. The rating and review feature would be available to both tutor and student after a 
					session has been completed. Tutors are able to rate the student out of 5 stars and are able to leave a bit of a 
					review on what the student is like. This is the same with the student. All of this would be anonymous and the 
					rating and reviews can only be seen by students if a student wrote it and vice-versa. More features maybe added 
					if idea is developed. This could include a meeting call for an online tutoring session to adapt to COVID-19.</p>

			 <h4>Tools and Technology</h4>
			 
			 <p>The tools and technologies needed to create my project idea are programs such Swift, JavaScript and Xcode. 
				 Using a computer to run these programs, an app can be created with the required knowledge on how to operate 
				 them with coding and developing an app.</p>
				
				 <h4>Skills Required</h4>
			
				<p>The skills required to develop this project idea is knowledge on front-end coding on developing and 
					designing an app. This meaning expert knowledge on Swift, JavaScript, etc. Other skills that maybe 
					required are problem-solving skills, communication with a team and leadership.</p>
			
				<h4>Outcome</h4>
			
					<p>If this app was to become successful, the outcome would be that students are better off with more 
						knowledge especially those who struggle. Hopefully students learn a lot from their tutors and continue 
						to use the app if they require assistance from other subjects. Even in the end, the students can 
						create a tutoring profile and pass on the knowledge to the future generation. This app would have 
						impacted those students beneficially helping them expand their knowledge.</p>
